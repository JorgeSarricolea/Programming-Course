# Operating Systems with Ubuntu Linux

A computer operating system is a software that manages the resources of a computer and facilitates interaction between users and the machine. In other words, it is the program that allows a user to use a computer or mobile device, and for programs to run on it.

The operating system is responsible for controlling and managing hardware resources such as memory, processor, hard disk, screen, among others, so that they can be effectively and efficiently used by programs running on the computer. It also provides a graphical or command-line interface for users to interact with the system and run programs easily.

There are different types of operating systems, including desktop operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux, used on personal computers; mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS, used on mobile devices; and server operating systems such as Windows Server and Linux, used in enterprise environments.

Among the main functions of an operating system are the management of hardware resources, file and directory management, process management, and memory management. Additionally, it also provides security and protection measures for user data and programs, as well as facilitating the installation and updating of software.

In summary, the operating system is a fundamental part of any electronic device, as it is responsible for managing resources and allowing users and programs to interact effectively and efficiently with the machine.

For the convenience of the course and for many of you, we will be using a Virtual Machine with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to install the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) Operating System.

I will leave you a link to YouTube so you can watch the installation of VirtualBox and Ubuntu. [How to install Ubuntu 22.10 LTS in VirtualBox 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYaCCpvjsEY)

## Ubuntu (Linux)

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on the Debian operating system. It is one of the most popular distributions and is designed to be easy to use and install. It is also available for free and has a large community of users and developers supporting it.

One of the main advantages of Ubuntu is its focus on security. It comes with a large number of pre-installed security tools, such as a firewall, an intrusion detection system, and encryption tools. Additionally, it is regularly updated to ensure the security and stability of the system.

Another advantage of Ubuntu is its compatibility with a wide range of hardware and software. It is compatible with a wide variety of devices, from desktop and laptop computers to servers and IoT devices. Additionally, it has a wide selection of software available through its package manager, making it easy to install and update applications.

Ubuntu is also known for its active and committed community, meaning there are a wealth of online resources and support available. Additionally, it has a large amount of documentation, tutorials, and online forums to help users troubleshoot problems and improve their experience with the operating system.

In summary, Ubuntu is a popular and reliable Linux distribution that offers security, compatibility, and a large support community for users. It is an excellent choice for those seeking an open-source and free alternative to commercial operating systems.

Now to practice our programming skills with Python, we will create a menu using commands in the Ubuntu (Linux) terminal:

STARTING LINUX COMMAND MENU

1. Find the largest file in D2 and the smallest file in D1.
2. Compare the files in the two directories (D1 and D2) and show the most recent and oldest.
3. Copy the contents of file2.txt into file3.txt.
4. Count the number of occurrences of the letters "r" and "R" in a file in D1.
5. Change the permissions of a file to executable only.
6. Change the owner and group of a file in D2.
7. Create a script to rename file4.txt.
8. Encrypt and decrypt file1.txt.
9. Quit.


Remember that in Python there is no Switch Case, so If statements would suffice.
