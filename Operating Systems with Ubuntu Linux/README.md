# Operating Systems with Ubuntu Linux

A computer operating system is a software that manages the resources of a computer and facilitates interaction between users and the machine. In other words, it is the program that allows a user to use a computer or mobile device, and for programs to run on it.

The operating system is responsible for controlling and managing hardware resources such as memory, processor, hard disk, screen, among others, so that they can be effectively and efficiently used by programs running on the computer. It also provides a graphical or command-line interface for users to interact with the system and run programs easily.

There are different types of operating systems, including desktop operating systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux, used on personal computers; mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS, used on mobile devices; and server operating systems such as Windows Server and Linux, used in enterprise environments.

Among the main functions of an operating system are the management of hardware resources, file and directory management, process management, and memory management. Additionally, it also provides security and protection measures for user data and programs, as well as facilitating the installation and updating of software.

In summary, the operating system is a fundamental part of any electronic device, as it is responsible for managing resources and allowing users and programs to interact effectively and efficiently with the machine.

For the convenience of the course and for many of you, we will be using a Virtual Machine with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to install the [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) Operating System.

I will leave you a link to YouTube so you can watch the installation of VirtualBox and Ubuntu. [How to install Ubuntu 22.10 LTS in VirtualBox 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYaCCpvjsEY)
