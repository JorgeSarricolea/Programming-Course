## JAVA Programming Language

Java is a programming language that allows you to create software applications that can run on a variety of devices, including computers, smartphones, and even cars.

One of the great things about Java is that it's easy to read and write, which makes it a good language for beginners. You can use Java to create a wide range of applications, from simple programs that print out a message to complex applications that handle large amounts of data.

Overall, Java is a great programming language for beginners because it's easy to learn and it's versatile enough to be used in a wide range of applications. With Java, you can start creating your own programs and apps in no time!

### Algorithms | Basic Level | JAVA

Below, I will leave you with some algorithms that you can program easily, remember that you can also find them already solved.

1. Print a "Hello, World!".
2. Program to calculate the area of a rectangle with predefined values.
3. Program to read an integer from the console and check if it is even or odd.
4. Program to calculate the sum of the first n integer numbers.
5. Program to print the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".
6. Program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integer numbers.

### Vectors and Matrix | Basic Level | JAVA

1.  Sum of two vectors.
2.  Find the maximum value in a vector.
3.  Sum of two matrices
4.  Multiplication of two matrices.

### Algorithms | Medium Level | JAVA

1. Write a program that reads a string of text and determines whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same from left to right as from right to left, such as "radar" or "a man a plan a canal panama".
2. Create a program that simulates the guessing game. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100 and give the user 10 attempts to guess the number. At each attempt, the program will indicate whether the user's number is greater or less than the generated number. If the user guesses the number, the program should end and display the number of attempts used. If the user does not guess the number after 10 attempts, the program should display the generated number and end.
3. Write a program that receives two strings of text and determines whether they are anagrams or not. Two strings of text are anagrams if they have the same letters but in different order, such as "roma" and "amor".
4. Create a program that simulates the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". The program should allow the user to enter their choice and generate a random choice for the computer. Then, the program should determine the winner according to the rules of the game and display the result on the screen.
5. Write a program that receives a string of text and determines which is the longest word in the string.

### Vectors and Matrix | Medium Level | JAVA

1. Write a program that reads in two vectors of integers of equal length and finds the dot product of the two vectors. The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements.
2. Create a program that takes in a matrix of integers and checks whether or not it is symmetric. A matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose. The program should print out whether or not the matrix is symmetric.
