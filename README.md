# Welcome to the Programming and Operating Systems Course 👋

First of all, I invite you to visit the Course Info [clicking here](https://jorgesarricolea.com/programming-course), where you can not only get more information about this course but also have Premium access so that I can personally teach you how to program step-by-step.

This small repository will help you understand basic programming concepts, algorithms, functions, and methods. You will find some theory and a series of examples and exercises to practice, and they will be solved so you can understand the code. Don't worry if you code it differently; as programmers, we think differently when solving a problem. 

The main languages we will be looking at are [Java](https://www.oracle.com/mx/java/technologies/downloads/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I recommend installing them and using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Remember that before starting to program, I recommend starting with the [Introduction to Git and Github](https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Git-Github-Introduction).

## Description
The course consists of 9 stages, a total of 28 hours. This course is delivered via live video calls on Discord, and it is 100% online. The languages covered in the course are Java and Python, and you only need internet and a computer to program.

### Stage 1. Train your logic to program. (1 hour).
The basic programming functions are a set of fundamental concepts that are used in almost any programming language. These functions include:

- Variables: A variable is a space in the computer's memory that is used to store a value. Variables can have different data types, such as numbers, text strings, or boolean values.

- Operators: Operators are symbols or keywords that are used to perform mathematical or logical operations. Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.

- Control structures: Control structures are code blocks that are used to control the flow of execution of a program. Control structures include loops (for, while, do-while) and conditional structures (if-else, switch-case).

- Functions: Functions are code blocks that can be called from anywhere in the program and perform a specific task. Functions can have input parameters and can return output values.

- Arrays: Arrays are a data structure that is used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays can be one or multi-dimensional.

- Input/Output: Input/output refers to how programs interact with the user or with other programs. Programs can receive data from the user through standard input (such as the keyboard) or through files. Output can be sent to the user through standard output (such as the screen) or through files.

- These basic programming functions are used together to create more complex programs and perform specific tasks. It is important to understand these basic functions before moving on to more advanced programming.

#### Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of instructions that are designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. It is a step-by-step procedure that takes some input, performs a series of operations on that input, and produces the desired output. Algorithms are used in many different fields, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering, and are essential in programming. They are used to develop software, design databases, and solve complex computational problems.

In computer science, algorithms are often expressed in a programming language, and they can be implemented in software as functions or methods. There are many different types of algorithms, including sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and optimization algorithms, each with its own specific purpose and implementation.

#### Methods
Methods in programming are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are reusable code snippets that can be called from other parts of the program, making the code more modular and easier to read and maintain.

Methods are declared with a specific name, a list of parameters (if any), and a return type (if any). When called, a method can accept arguments passed in by the caller and perform some computation on them. The method may then return a value, which can be used by the caller.

Methods can be used to break up a large problem into smaller, more manageable parts. They can also be used to abstract away details of a particular implementation, making the code more flexible and easier to modify in the future.

In object-oriented programming, methods are often associated with objects or classes. They can be used to define the behavior of an object or to provide a set of operations that can be performed on the object.

#### Vectors
A vector is a one-dimensional array that stores a sequence of values of the same data type. Vectors in Java are implemented as arrays, which means that the size of the vector is fixed at the time of creation. Elements of the vector can be accessed using an index, which starts at 0 for the first element.

Vectors in Java are often used to store collections of data that need to be processed in a particular order. For example, we can use a vector to store the results of a sequence of computations, or to represent a sequence of points in a geometric shape.

#### Matrix
A matrix, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional array of elements. A matrix can be thought of as a table of data, where each element is identified by its row and column indices. Matrices are commonly used to represent mathematical objects such as linear transformations, or to store tabular data such as the grades of students in multiple classes. In Java, you can create a matrix using a two-dimensional array.

### Stage 2. Flowcharts. (1 hour).
Flowcharts are important tools in programming as they aid in designing, planning, and communicating the logical flow of a program. They facilitate debugging, code maintenance, and performance optimization. They are also useful for learning and documentation purposes, providing a clear visual representation of the program's structure and logic.

### Stage 3. Preparing workspace. (1 - 2 hours).
You need a good environment to work efficiently. The right programs and tools that I recommend in this course are the ones that have worked perfectly for me and the tech industry.

- VSCode installation
- Java Programming Languaje
- Python Programming Languaje
- Git and GitHub installation
- Some extensions to VSCode

### Stage 6. Fundamental data structures. (3 hours).
Data structures are fundamental components in computer science and programming that play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. They provide a way to store, manipulate, and access data in a structured manner. The importance of data structures can be summarized as follows:

- Efficient data organization: Data structures enable efficient organization and storage of data. They allow for quick and convenient access, insertion, deletion, and modification of data elements. By choosing appropriate data structures, programmers can optimize the performance of algorithms and operations on the data.

- Algorithm design and analysis: Data structures are closely related to algorithm design and analysis. The choice of data structure can significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of algorithms. Different data structures are suited for different types of problems and operations. Understanding and selecting the right data structure can lead to more efficient algorithms and better overall performance.

- Memory utilization: Data structures help in optimizing memory utilization. They provide techniques for allocating and deallocating memory dynamically, which can be crucial when dealing with large datasets or limited memory resources. Efficient memory management through data structures reduces wastage and improves overall performance.

### Stage 7. Introduction to virtual machines. (4 hours).
Virtual machines (VMs) are software-based emulations of physical computers that can run multiple operating systems or applications on a single physical machine. They provide an isolated and virtualized environment where software can be executed independently of the underlying hardware. The importance of virtual machines can be summarized as follows:

- Hardware abstraction: Virtual machines abstract the underlying hardware, allowing software to run on different types of machines without modification. This provides flexibility and portability, as VMs can be migrated between physical servers or hosted in the cloud.

- Resource optimization: Virtual machines enable the efficient utilization of hardware resources. Multiple VMs can be run simultaneously on a single physical machine, effectively sharing the CPU, memory, and storage resources. This maximizes resource utilization and reduces hardware costs.

- Isolation and security: VMs provide a level of isolation between different software instances running on the same physical machine. Each VM operates independently, with its own virtualized hardware and operating system. This isolation enhances security by preventing one VM from impacting or accessing the resources of another.

Now you must to prepare your workspace and configure the Virtual Machine with VirtualBox.

1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
2. Download [Ubuntu ISO](https://ubuntu.com/download)
3. [Let me teach you!](https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Programming-Course/tree/main/Operating%20Systems%20with%20Ubuntu%20Linux) how to configure Ubuntu in VirtualBox 

### Stage 8. Introduction to Linux (Ubuntu) and command terminal. (2 hours).
After the installation and configuration of our workspace, it's time to understand how the command-line terminal works. From now on, we will be exploring different commands to perform specific functions, such as creating folders or files. I recommend that you visit my [Linux-Commands](https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Linux-Commands) repository for a handy guide on this topic.

### Stage 9. Final project. Creating an options menu in Ubuntu with Python. (3 - 5 hours).
We will create a menu of options using a switch-case structure, but here's the thing: in Python, there is no built-in switch-case construct like in Java. Instead, we can utilize a Python library that allows us to execute commands from a program.
