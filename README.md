# Programming-Club

Welcome to the Programming Club! This small repository will help you understand basic programming concepts, algorithms, functions, and methods. You will find some theory and a series of examples and exercises to practice, and they will be solved so you can understand the code. Don't worry if you code it differently; as programmers, we think differently when solving a problem. 

The important thing is that it is efficient and functional. The main languages we will be looking at are Java and Python. I recommend installing them and using VSCode.

Remember that before starting to program, I recommend starting with the [Introduction to Git and Github](https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/Programming-Club/edit/main/README.md).

## Fundamentals

The basic programming functions are a set of fundamental concepts that are used in almost any programming language. These functions include:

- Variables: A variable is a space in the computer's memory that is used to store a value. Variables can have different data types, such as numbers, text strings, or boolean values.

- Operators: Operators are symbols or keywords that are used to perform mathematical or logical operations. Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Logical operators include AND, OR, and NOT.

- Control structures: Control structures are code blocks that are used to control the flow of execution of a program. Control structures include loops (for, while, do-while) and conditional structures (if-else, switch-case).

- Functions: Functions are code blocks that can be called from anywhere in the program and perform a specific task. Functions can have input parameters and can return output values.

- Arrays: Arrays are a data structure that is used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays can be one or multi-dimensional.

- Input/Output: Input/output refers to how programs interact with the user or with other programs. Programs can receive data from the user through standard input (such as the keyboard) or through files. Output can be sent to the user through standard output (such as the screen) or through files.

- These basic programming functions are used together to create more complex programs and perform specific tasks. It is important to understand these basic functions before moving on to more advanced programming.

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. It is a step-by-step procedure that takes some input, performs a series of operations on that input, and produces the desired output. Algorithms are used in many different fields, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering, and are essential in programming. They are used to develop software, design databases, and solve complex computational problems.

In computer science, algorithms are often expressed in a programming language, and they can be implemented in software as functions or methods. There are many different types of algorithms, including sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and optimization algorithms, each with its own specific purpose and implementation.

## Methods

Methods in programming are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are reusable code snippets that can be called from other parts of the program, making the code more modular and easier to read and maintain.

Methods are declared with a specific name, a list of parameters (if any), and a return type (if any). When called, a method can accept arguments passed in by the caller and perform some computation on them. The method may then return a value, which can be used by the caller.

Methods can be used to break up a large problem into smaller, more manageable parts. They can also be used to abstract away details of a particular implementation, making the code more flexible and easier to modify in the future.

In object-oriented programming, methods are often associated with objects or classes. They can be used to define the behavior of an object or to provide a set of operations that can be performed on the object.

## Vectors

A vector is a one-dimensional array that stores a sequence of values of the same data type. Vectors in Java are implemented as arrays, which means that the size of the vector is fixed at the time of creation. Elements of the vector can be accessed using an index, which starts at 0 for the first element.

Vectors in Java are often used to store collections of data that need to be processed in a particular order. For example, we can use a vector to store the results of a sequence of computations, or to represent a sequence of points in a geometric shape.

## Matrix

A matrix, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional array of elements. A matrix can be thought of as a table of data, where each element is identified by its row and column indices. Matrices are commonly used to represent mathematical objects such as linear transformations, or to store tabular data such as the grades of students in multiple classes. In Java, you can create a matrix using a two-dimensional array.
