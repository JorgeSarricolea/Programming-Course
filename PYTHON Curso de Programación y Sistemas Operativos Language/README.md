## PYTHON Programming Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It's widely used in many different fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing.

One of the reasons why Python is so popular is because of its easy-to-learn syntax. Python code is often described as being "executable pseudocode" because it reads like plain English. This makes it an ideal language for beginners who are just starting to learn programming.

Python is also known for its vast library of modules and packages, which make it easy to accomplish complex tasks with just a few lines of code. Additionally, Python is an interpreted language, which means that you can write and run code on-the-fly without having to compile it first.

Overall, Python is a great language for beginners and experts alike because of its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Whether you're interested in web development, data analysis, or AI, Python has something to offer. With its extensive library of modules and user-friendly syntax, Python is a valuable tool for anyone looking to learn programming or tackle a new project.

### Algorithms | Basic Level | PYTHON

Here are 6 basic exercises in Python, remember that you can also find them already solved.

1. Create a program that asks the user for their name and welcomes them.
2. Create a program that asks the user for two numbers and multiplies them.
3. Create a program that asks the user for their age and tells them if they are of legal age or not.
4. Create a program that asks the user for a word and prints it backwards.
5. Create a program that calculates the area of a triangle. The user must enter the base and height.
6. Create a program that asks the user for a list of numbers and calculates their average.

### Vectors and Matrix | Basic Level | PYTHON

1. Create a program that asks the user for two vectors of three elements each. Then, print the sum of the vectors.
2. Create a program that asks the user for a vector of five elements. Then, find the maximum element in the vector and display its index and corresponding value.
3. Create a program that asks the user for a 2x2 matrix. Then, find the determinant of the matrix and display it on the screen.
4. Create a program that asks the user for two 2x2 matrices. Then, print the sum of the matrices.

### Algorithms | Medium Level | PYTHON

1. Create a program that asks the user for a vector of n elements, where n is an odd number. Then, find the middle element of the vector and display it on the screen.
2. Create a program that asks the user for two vectors of equal length. Then, find the dot product of the vectors and display it on the screen.
3. Create a program that asks the user for a vector of five elements. Then, sort the vector from smallest to largest and display the result on the screen.
4. Create a program that asks the user for two vectors of equal length. Then, find the resulting vector from the subtraction of the two vectors and display it on the screen.
5. Create a program that asks the user for two matrices of equal size. Then, find the sum of the two matrices and display it on the screen.
6. Create a program that asks the user for a matrix of size n x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. Then, find the minimum value of each row and display it on the screen.
7. Create a program that asks the user for a matrix of size n x m and an integer k. Then, find the number of elements in the matrix that are greater than k and display it on the screen.
8. Create a program that asks the user for two matrices of size n x m, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. Then, find the matrix product of the two matrices and display it on the screen.
9. Create a program that asks the user for a sentence and then counts the number of vowels in the sentence using a loop and displays the result on the screen.
10. Create a program that asks the user for two strings and checks if they are anagrams (have the same letters in a different order) using a function and displays the result on the screen.
