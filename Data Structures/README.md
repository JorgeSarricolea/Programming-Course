# Data structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data on a computer so that it can be efficiently used. Imagine you have a box with a bunch of objects inside, and you need to find a particular object. If the box isn't organized in some way, you'll have to go through each object one by one until you find the one you need. But if the objects are organized into compartments or drawers, you can find the object much faster and more efficiently.

In programming, data structures are very similar. There are different types of data structures used to store different types of data, and each structure has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency and ease of use. For example, some types of data structures are better for quickly searching for specific data, while others are better for adding or removing data.

Some common examples of data structures include:

- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash tables

As you learn more about programming and software development, you'll learn how to use these data structures to solve problems and improve the efficiency of your programs.

# Crear un arreglo de números enteros
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Imprimir el arreglo completo
print("El arreglo es:", arr)

# Acceder al primer elemento del arreglo (índice 0)
print("El primer elemento es:", arr[0])

# Acceder al último elemento del arreglo (índice -1)
print("El último elemento es:", arr[-1])

# Modificar un elemento del arreglo (índice 3)
arr[3] = 10
print("El nuevo arreglo es:", arr)

# Obtener la longitud del arreglo
print("La longitud del arreglo es:", len(arr))

# Recorrer el arreglo usando un ciclo for
print("Los elementos del arreglo son:")
for elemento in arr:
    print(elemento)
